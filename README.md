# Parallel_Imaris_Writer
An efficient converter that writes TIFF and Zarr image stacks to the Imaris 5 (.ims) file format, utilizing cpp-tiff, cpp-zarr, the ImarisWriter, and OpenMP. The output is a single multi-resolution .ims file ready for visualization and analysis in Imaris.

## Limitations
1. Only 3D image stacks are supported (single or multiple channels, single or multiple timepoints). Reading inherits the cpp-tiff and cpp-zarr limitations (for example, planar RGB TIFFs are not supported).
2. 8, 16, and 32 bit data are supported; 64 bit data is not yet supported by the Imaris Converter.
3. Block processing (`-C`) can split a Zarr along all three axes, but a TIFF can only be split along Z (full XY slices) — a limitation of the TIFF format.

## Releases

Prebuilt release folders for Linux, Mac, and Windows are available from the [releases page](https://github.com/abcucberkeley/Parallel_Imaris_Writer/releases): download, unzip, and run the `parallelimariswriter` executable inside.

## CMake

The converter is built with the CMakeLists.txt file.

### Prerequisites
1. All dependencies (cpp-tiff, cpp-zarr, the ImarisWriter, HDF5, LZ4, zlib, and nlohmann/json) are fetched automatically at configure time via CMake FetchContent, so an internet connection is required for the first configure. On Linux and Mac, libuuid is built from the tarball included with cpp-zarr.
2. Currently the only officially supported compiler is gcc on Linux and Mac and MinGW on Windows but others may work. On Mac, use Homebrew gcc (Apple Clang does not support OpenMP).

### Download and Install
````
git clone https://github.com/abcucberkeley/Parallel_Imaris_Writer
cd Parallel_Imaris_Writer
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
cmake --build build --target release
````
The `release` target assembles a self-contained folder, `build/Parallel_Imaris_Writer/`, containing the `parallelimariswriter` executable and its shared libraries, ready to run in place.

## Usage

The converter finds its inputs by matching a file-name pattern inside one or more folders. Each file whose name contains a pattern is treated as a timepoint, and multiple comma-separated patterns are treated as multiple channels. The result is written as `<output-directory>/<name>.ims`.

### Options
| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-r` | Reader: `tiff` or `zarr` (default: `tiff`) |
| `-F` | Comma-separated input folder(s) to search |
| `-P` | Comma-separated file-name pattern(s), one per channel (files whose names contain a pattern are matched) |
| `-o` | Output directory (default: the first input folder) |
| `-n` | Output file name without extension (default: `output`, producing `output.ims`) |
| `-v` | Voxel size in microns as `X,Y,Z` (default: `1.08,1.08,1.08`) |
| `-c` | Number of channels (default: inferred from the number of patterns) |
| `-t` | Number of timepoints (default: inferred from the matching files) |
| `-b` | Imaris output block (chunk) size as `X,Y,Z` (default: the reader's native chunk size) |
| `-B` | Bounding box to crop the input as `Xmin,Ymin,Zmin,Xmax,Ymax,Zmax` |
| `-C` | Processing block size as `X,Y,Z` — the amount of a timepoint held in RAM at once. Zarr is blocked in all three axes; TIFF only in Z. Values larger than the image simply read the whole image. Omit to process a whole timepoint at once. |

### Examples

Convert a folder of TIFF stacks (files containing "CamA") into `output.ims`:
````
parallelimariswriter -r tiff -F /path/to/tiffs -P CamA -o /path/to/out -v 0.108,0.108,0.2
````

Convert Zarr stacks:
````
parallelimariswriter -r zarr -F /path/to/zarrs -P CamA -o /path/to/out -v 0.108,0.108,0.2
````

Two channels (files containing "CamA" and "CamB"):
````
parallelimariswriter -r zarr -F /path/to/data -P CamA,CamB -o /path/to/out
````

Bounded memory for a large image — process 512 x 512 x 256 voxels at a time:
````
parallelimariswriter -r zarr -F /path/to/zarrs -P CamA -o /path/to/out -C 512,512,256
````
